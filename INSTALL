Installing NITLog
-----------------

You'll need a PHP4-capable web server and a modicum of patience.
The quickest way to get going looks like this:

    - procure a web-accessible directory, which we'll call DIR.

    - make a subdirectory DIR/nitlog.

    - if you want, put an index.html in DIR that redirects to DIR/nitlog.

    - copy index.php, defs.inc.php, parser.inc.php, and optionally rss.php
      and img.php, to DIR/nitlog.

    - copy (cp -a) the contents of 'example' to DIR/nitlog.

    - make appropriate changes to DIR/nitlog/config.inc.php.

You should now be able to point your browser at
http://www.domain.com/~username/nitlog/ and see the included sample entry.

Fancier Stuff
-------------

I like having multiple areas of my site handled by NITLog in different
subdirectories, sharing various facets of their configuration.  For
example, in addition to the 'nitlog' directory, I have a 'home' directory,
a directory for various thumbnail picture galleries, etc, each of which has
NITLog installed in them.  You can move any common files, such as your
layout.inc.html file, up a level (to DIR) and change the appropriate
setting in config.inc.php to point there.

Feel free to try the stuff in 'fancy-example', which is approximately what
I use for my own site.  See dcoombs.inc.html for the layout.
